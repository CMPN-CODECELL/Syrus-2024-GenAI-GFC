# EXPANSION OF EV STATIONS:
The project predicts future electric vehicle (EV) demand based on population, purchasing power, existing users, and incentives. Recognizing current infrastructure's insufficiency, it proposes strategic charging point placement (parking lots, stations, businesses) and continued incentives (tax credits, infrastructure support, preferential access) to build a sustainable, EV-ready future.
